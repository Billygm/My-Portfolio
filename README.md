# My-Portfolio

This is my first portfolio as a Web Developer, created using html and css. It's still a work in progress, mostly because I have no web applications to showcase yet.

If you click on the nav links at the top they jump you down the page to that section

Because I have no web applications yet I linked my placeholder projects to my github for now.

All the links in the contact me section are working and accurate (my LinkedIn needs a lot of work still...)
